# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

### Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

This example requires Python 3.5 to run the test suites

It also requires a fairly new release of OpenSSL for running TLSv1.2 that is required by STM.

After trying Raspberry Pi with Raspbian and EC2 AWS instances with AMI I finally found one good distro with all the right tools. It was Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release which will be supported for 4 years.

### SSL certification

In order to use SSL certificates you need to add your service instance certificates in the VesselVIS directory.  The code will look for the files
```
VesselVIS/Certificate_VIS*.pem
VesselVIS/PrivateKey_VIS*.pem
VesselVIS/mc-ca-chain.pem
```

As the MarineCloud certificates are self-signed you also need to set them up correctly for OpenSSL. This is done by running a script.
```
VesselVIS/setup_MC_certs.sh
```

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
https://stm.furuno.fi:8001/ui/ -- Vessel 1
https://stm.furuno.fi:8002/ui/ -- Vessel 2
https://stm.furuno.fi:8003/ui/ -- Vessel 3
https://stm.furuno.fi:8004/ui/ -- Vessel 4
...
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
https://stm.furuno.fi:8002/swagger.json
```

To set up the env environment for testing, launch tox:
```
sudo pip3 install tox
tox
```

To run the integration test suite we need to launch two vessel service instances that are capable of communicating with each other
```
./run_VIS_unittests.sh
```

By peeking inside the previous script you have examples of how to run single tests.
